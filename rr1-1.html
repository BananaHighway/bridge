I'll try to review some of the more memorable hands of my first international event in the open team in these blog posts.

First match of the tournament was against India with 4 unfamiliar faces, and I had a chance to get a big swing on the second board.

Perhaps North could have bid more scientifically with 3H first after 3C to show some heart values and then I would be able to sign off in 3S knowing that those cards were wasted. Nevertheless, the T9x spades and Ax clubs made 4S look like a good bet.

After winning the second trick, I took some time to consider my options. EW plays 15-17 NT, forcing free bids and leads 3rd/5th against suits. Diamonds were most likely splitting 3-4 based on the auction and the opening lead, this meant that East almost certainly held a 12-14 balanced hand (since he only had 4 diamonds and failed to act after 2S). Another clue was that the opponents had 22 HCPs combined and a 9 card heart fit, so I was pretty sure that the hearts were splitting 5-4 and it was all down to the black suit distributions. Should I play east for 2=4=4=3 or 3=4=4=2? On the table I thought it was obvious to play for the second case since it would cover more winning layouts (Hxx and KQx spades, and decide later on whether to play him for Kx or Jx clubs) and leading a small spade out from hand certainly looked like the easier way out. It didn't work out on this hand and I had to go down 1.

Thinking back, it looks like an about even guess to me which black suits distribution to play for (if we can get the clubs right the KQx spade case is irrelevant how we tackle the suit). Of course, there is some issue that could be easily overlooked if east started with KQ8 spades, for instance, like this:

Playing small spade out from hand or crossing to the Ace club and then leading the 10 of spade would both work fine, but the latter play requires more carefulness. After east covers the 10, we must win the Ace of spade and lead out the Queen of clubs immediately to prevent east from overruffing the third club (if we just simply draw trumps now and hope to tackle clubs later). Or even more amazingly, play the Queen club on the third trick but definitely it seems a little bit too committal.
